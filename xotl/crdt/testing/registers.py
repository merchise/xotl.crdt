# I'm splitting the concurrent from the non-concurrent machinery.  Because
# using a strictly monotonic time function allows for this simple test-model:
#
#     Time     Replica 1      Replica 2  ...     Model
#     1        set to x                          x
#     2                       set to y           y
#
# There's no problem to update the Model to y, because Time is total, even
# though the vector clocks of the replicas are concurrent ([1, 0] and [0, 1])
# their timestamp makes Replica 2 a winner.
#
# The problem happens with the following:
#
#    Time   R0           R1           R2           Model
#    0      set to 1                               1
#    0                   set to 2                  2
#
# At this moment synchronize R2 merging R0 first: 'R2 << R1' is True because
# R2's vclock is empty.  But after the merge, R2's is concurrent with R1 and
# 'R1 << R2' so the value of R1 is discarded; R2 keeps the value 1 (doesn't
# agree with Model) but R2 is now a descedant of R1 and R0.
#
# If we now merge R1 with R2 it will adjust it's value to 1.
#
# So I think, the way to test LWWRegister is to perform a full-synchronization
# and test that all replicas reached the same value.
