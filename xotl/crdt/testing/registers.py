# I'm splitting the concurrent from the non-concurrent machinery.  Because
# using a strictly monotonic time function allows for this simple test-model:
#
#     Time     Replica 1      Replica 2  ...     Model
#     1        set to x                          x
#     2                       set to y           y
#
# There's no problem to update the Model to y, because Time is total, even
# though the vector clocks of the replicas are concurrent ([1, 0] and [0, 1])
# their timestamp makes Replica 2 a winner.
#
# The problem happens with:
#
#     Time     Replica 1      Replica 2  ...     Model
#     1        set to x       set to y           ?
#
# What is the right value for Model?  Worst yet with three replicas:
#
#     Time     Replica 1      Replica 2   Replica 3     Model
#     1        set to x       set to y                  ?
#     2                       set to z    set to a      ?
